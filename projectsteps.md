### 1. **Environment Setup and Data Collection**
   - Ensure a robust environment with Python, PyTorch, pandas, Matplotlib/Seaborn, scikit-learn, and Jupyter Notebook.
   - Download the Titanic dataset from Kaggle and perform an initial assessment.

### 2. **Data Preprocessing**
   - **Data Cleaning**: Identify and handle missing values systematically. Consider imputation techniques for continuous variables (like mean or median imputation) and categorical variables (like mode imputation or predictive modeling).
   - **Feature Engineering**: Analyze the dataset for potential new features. E.g., derive titles from names, aggregate SibSp and Parch into a family size feature, etc.
   - **Categorical Encoding**: Convert categorical variables using one-hot encoding or label encoding, as appropriate.
   - **Feature Scaling**: Normalize or standardize features, especially for distance-based models and neural networks.

### 3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Utilize statistical analysis and visualizations to understand the data distribution, outliers, and correlations.
   - Perform hypothesis testing where applicable to validate assumptions or findings.

### 4. **Data Splitting**
   - Split the data into training, validation, and testing sets. Consider stratified sampling to maintain the distribution of key variables.

### 5. **Baseline Model Development**
   - Develop a simple model (like Logistic Regression) as a baseline. This serves as a point of comparison for more complex models.

### 6. **Advanced Model Development**
   - **PyTorch Neural Network**: Design a neural network architecture. Experiment with different layers, neurons, activation functions, and optimizers.
   - **Classical Machine Learning Models**: Experiment with various algorithms (Random Forest, SVM, Gradient Boosting) using scikit-learn.

### 7. **Cross-Validation and Hyperparameter Tuning**
   - Implement k-fold cross-validation to evaluate model performance.
   - Use grid search or random search for hyperparameter optimization.

### 8. **Model Evaluation**
   - Evaluate models using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and ROC-AUC.
   - Employ confusion matrices, ROC curves, and other plots to visualize performance.

### 9. **Ensemble Techniques**
   - Explore ensemble methods (like stacking, bagging, or boosting) to improve model performance.

### 10. **Model Interpretability**
   - Use techniques like feature importance, SHAP values, or Lime to interpret model predictions.

### 11. **Results Analysis and Reporting**
   - Analyze the results in-depth, noting any significant findings or anomalies.
   - Document the methodology, results, and insights in a clear and concise manner.

### 12. **Code Modularization**
   - Structure the code into modules for data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and utility functions.
   - Ensure code readability and maintainability.

### 13. **Version Control and Repository Management**
   - Use Git for version control. Regularly commit changes with descriptive messages.
   - Organize the repository with a clear README, requirements.txt, and a logical folder structure.

### 14. **Final Model Selection and Testing**
   - Choose the best-performing model based on validation results.
   - Test the final model on the testing set to estimate real-world performance.

### 15. **Kaggle Submission (if applicable)**
   - Prepare the submission file according to Kaggle's format and submit your predictions.
